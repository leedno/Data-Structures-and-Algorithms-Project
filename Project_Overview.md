# Overview of Data Structures and Algorithms Implemented

## 1. Introduction
This project implements and analyzes fundamental data structures and algorithms, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and tree traversal techniques. The primary aim is to understand their behavior and performance characteristics.

## 2. Data Structures Implemented

### Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. They allow constant-time access to elements by index but have a fixed size once created.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insertion, deletion, access.

### Linked Lists
Linked lists consist of nodes that contain data and pointers to the next node. They allow dynamic memory allocation but have slower access times compared to arrays.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insertions, deletions, and traversals.

### Stacks
A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added or removed from the top of the stack.

- **Implemented Operations**: Push, pop, peek.

### Queues
A queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

- **Implemented Operations**: Enqueue, dequeue.

### Trees
Binary trees consist of nodes where each node has at most two children. 

- **Implemented Algorithms**: Pre-order, In-order, Post-order traversals.

### Hash Tables
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs using a hash function.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insert, delete, search with collision handling.

## 3. Algorithms Implemented

### Sorting Algorithms
#### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Searching Algorithms
#### Linear Search
Linear Search checks each element in the list until the target element is found.

#### Binary Search
Binary Search efficiently finds an item from a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## 4. Performance Analysis
The performance of the sorting and searching algorithms has been analyzed and compared using various input sizes. Detailed performance metrics can be found in the **Performance Analysis Report**.
