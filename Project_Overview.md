# Overview of Data Structures and Algorithms Implemented

## 1. Introduction
This project implements and analyzes fundamental data structures and algorithms, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, tree traversal techniques, and advanced data structures. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these essential algorithms, their time and space complexities, and their performance across various scenarios.

## 2. Data Structures Implemented

### Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. They provide constant-time access to elements by index, but their size is fixed once created.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insertion, deletion, access, and traversal.

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear collection of nodes, where each node points to the next in the sequence. It allows dynamic memory allocation but offers slower access times compared to arrays due to its linear nature.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insertion, deletion, traversal.

### Stacks
Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The primary operations are push (to add an element) and pop (to remove the most recently added element).

- **Implemented Operations**: Push, pop, peek.

### Queues
Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back of the queue (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).

- **Implemented Operations**: Enqueue, dequeue, peek.

### Binary Search Trees (BST)
A binary search tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, and the left child is less than the parent node while the right child is greater. This structure enables efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insertion, deletion, search, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

### Balanced Binary Trees
Balanced binary trees maintain an optimal height to ensure operations like search, insertion, and deletion occur in logarithmic time. An example is the **AVL Tree**, which keeps the heights of the subtrees balanced during insertions and deletions.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insertion, deletion, search, balancing (rotations).

### Hash Tables
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It provides efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.

- **Implemented Operations**: Insertion, deletion, search, and collision resolution using methods like linear probing or chaining.

## 3. Algorithms Implemented

### Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no further swaps are needed.

#### Heap Sort
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages a binary heap data structure. It first builds a max heap and repeatedly extracts the largest element, maintaining the heap property.

#### Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a comparison-based algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time. It inserts each element into its correct position by comparing it with elements already in the sorted portion.

#### Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

#### Quick Sort
Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array into elements smaller and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.

#### Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.

### Searching Algorithms

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is an algorithm for searching a tree or graph. It starts at the root node and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

#### Binary Search
Binary Search is a highly efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the value in the middle of the interval, it narrows the interval to the lower half, otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or a stack.

## 4. Tree Traversal Algorithms

### Pre-order Traversal
In pre-order traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by the left subtree and then the right subtree.

### In-order Traversal
In in-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the root node, and then the right subtree. This traversal produces a sorted sequence for binary search trees.

### Post-order Traversal
In post-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. This is useful for tasks such as deleting nodes in a binary tree.

## 5. Performance Analysis
The performance of the implemented sorting and searching algorithms has been analyzed and compared using different input sizes. Time complexity, space complexity, and execution time have been considered to assess the algorithms' efficiency and scalability. The detailed performance metrics can be found in the **Performance Analysis Report**.
